VL53L1X range sensor - C++ library
==================================

The VL53L1X is the latest Time Of Flight (ToF) sensor to be released. It uses a VCSEL (vertical cavity surface emitting laser) to emit a class 1 IR laser and time the reflection to the target. What does all this mean? You can measure the distance to an object up to 4 meters away with millimeter resolution! Thatâ€™s pretty incredible.
